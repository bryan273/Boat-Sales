# Boat Sales
## Background
Nearly New Nautical is a website that allows users to advertise their boats for sale. The marketing team is preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners. The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get more views of their boat, as well as stay on top of market trends. The Head of Marketing has laid out an ambitious goal of increasing the number of readers by 75% this year
## Goals
Analyzed data to gain insights into answering the following question.
* Are the most expensive boats get the most views? 
* Are there common features among the most viewed boats?

## Analysis
The analysis could be seen from the Presentation.pdf

## Conclusion
Used boat tends to get more views when they're cheaper, but new boat views for expensive or cheap price are both high. Also, among most viewed boats, they have the same features, such as having a lower area, made of wood, located in Switzerland, was a sport boat. Also, used boats get more views in older years and new boats in newer years.

## Recommendation
* Adding cheaper used boats could lead to higher viewers
* The newsletter should be spread more in the Switzerland area
* Most of the boats should be made of wood and was a sport boat
* For used boats, considering selling lower area of boats
